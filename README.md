# Private Vulnerability Reporting

Someone from the community has just identified a potential vulnerability in your open source project. Do you want them to look the other way? Or do you want to know what they found?

With the new Private Vulnerability Reporting feature, public repository owners can receive private reports from community members. The benefit? You can assess the report and take appropriate action before a vulnerability becomes widely known.

Use this repository to test out the feature from the "reporter" perspective! 

This feature is still in beta, and [your feedback](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions) helps GitHub make this process smooth and seamless for everyone.

Thank you for being a part of the open source community!
